Write an SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Logs table:
+----+-----+
| id | num |
+----+-----+
| 1  | 1   |
| 2  | 1   |
| 3  | 1   |
| 4  | 2   |
| 5  | 1   |
| 6  | 2   |
| 7  | 2   |
+----+-----+
Output: 
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+
Explanation: 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.

SELECT DISTINCT l.num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM Logs AS l
    INNER JOIN logs AS l_next1 ON l.id + 1 = l_next1.id
    INNER JOIN logs AS l_next2 ON l_next1.id + 1 = l_next2.id
WHERE l.num=l_next1.num AND l_next1.num=l_next2.num;
